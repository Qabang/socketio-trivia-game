# Trivia Game with Socket.io

A small trivia game I built as my project in the course about socket.io.
The game uses the Open Trivia Databases (https://opentdb.com) API for the questions and the answers.

## Set up project

Run the command in the root folder.

- `npm install`.

## Run the application

When you are done with the import run the following commands in the root folder:

- `npm run dev`.

If no errors occured you can visit the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
